		<p>
	We've built our reputation on making it easy for you to keep your home and office safe and clean. <br>
	Our cleaners use EPA-registered cleaning products and follow CDC guidelines, not only cleaning and straightening up your space, 
	but also disinfecting all high-touch surfaces and areas.<br>
    Basic UV disinfection treatments are included as part of our core services. 
    This powerful non-toxic technology eliminates pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, without using harmful chemicals or leaving behind residue.<br>
    In the rare event you're not satisfied with the quality of the service, we will make it right with our Great Clean Guarantee.
    Lastly, MyClean cares about our employees' health and wellbeing. Our cleaners are employees, not gig economy workers. <br>
	And we provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, UV safety glasses, and personal thermometers. 
	Our protocols require cleaners to take their temperature daily and to request time off immediately if they are feeling unwell.
